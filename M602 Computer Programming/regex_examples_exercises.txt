# Student Tasks:
# 1. Modify example_basic_matching to find words with more than 5 letters.
# 2. Extend example_extracting_data to also extract the name from the string.
# 3. In example_file_reading, add functionality to count how many times each type of message (Error, Warning, Info) appears.
# 4. Create a new example that replaces all email addresses in a text with "[email hidden]".
