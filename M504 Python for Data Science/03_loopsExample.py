# What to try out
#################
# 1 - Read a string from the user, and Print characters present at an even index number
#  E.g., Hello world, the output (H, l o w r d)
# 2 - Write a Python code to remove characters from a string from 0 to n and print the new string
# Hint, Use string slicing to get a substring. For example, remove the first four characters using s[4:]
# 3 - Find the number of occurrences of a substring in a string
# Hint, Use string method count(). E.g., s.count("something")
# 4 - Write a Python code to check if the given number is palindrome. A palindrome number is a number that is the same after reverse. For example, 545 is the palindrome number.
# Hint,Reverse the given number and save it in a different variable. Use the if condition to check if the original and reverse numbers are identical. 
# 5 - Given two lists of numbers, write a Python code to create a new list such that the latest list should contain odd numbers from the first list and even numbers from the second list.
# Hints, 
# Create an empty list named result_list
# Iterate the first list using a for loop
# In each iteration check if the current number is odd using the num % 2 != 0 formula. If the current number is odd, add it to the result list
# Now, Iterate the second list using a loop.
# In each iteration check if the current number is even using the num % 2 == 0 formula. If the current number is even, add it to the result list.
# Print the result list.
# 6 - You can user several loops. Write a program which outputs a multiplication
# table from 1 to 100 (1x1=1, 1x2=2, etc.)
