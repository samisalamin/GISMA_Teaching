# What to try out
#################
# - Write a function that asks for the sex and greets accordingly
#- Write a program to create function func1() to accept a variable length of arguments and print their value.
#- Write a program to create a function show_employee() using the following conditions.
#It should accept the employeeâ€™s name and salary and display both.
#If the salary is missing in the function call then assign default value 9000 to salary
# Write a function called display_student(name, age), tht prints the name and age of the student. Assign a new name show_tudent(name, age) to it and call it using the new name.
# Hint, you can assign the name function into a new name similare to any variable
# Write a function to find the maximum number in a list, without using the max() function
# Hint: you can sort the list and return the correct position (using sort() function), or iterate over all the values and find the max
# Write a Python function that takes a string as input and returns a dictionary containing the number of uppercase and lowercase characters in the string. Any characters that cannot be categorized as uppercase or lowercase (e.g., symbols) should be counted as "other".
# Write a Python function that takes a list of strings as input and returns a tuple containing the shortest and longest word from the list, in that order. If there are multiple words of the same shortest or longest length, return the first shortest/longest word found.
# Write a Python function that takes a list and an element as input. The function should add the element to the list only if it's not already present in the list.
