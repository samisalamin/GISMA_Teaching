Week 1

1. Python Task: Suspicious Activity Detection (20–30 min)
Objective: Practice basic log analysis using Python.

Task:

You’re given a simplified log file (e.g., access_log.txt) with entries like:
2025-07-11 10:15:23 | 192.168.1.10 | LOGIN_SUCCESS
2025-07-11 10:16:01 | 192.168.1.10 | LOGIN_FAILED
Write a Python script to:
Count how many times each IP appears.
Identify IPs with more than 3 failed login attempts.
Print a list of suspicious IPs.
Bonus: Visualize the number of failed attempts per IP using a bar chart (optional for advanced students).


2. Research Task: Forensic Tools in Business (15–20 min)
Objective: Explore real-world tools used in digital forensics.

Task:

Choose one digital forensic tool (e.g., Autopsy, FTK, EnCase, Sleuth Kit).
Research:
What it does.
How it’s used in business investigations.
One real-world case where it was applied (if available).
Submit a short summary (150–200 words) or prepare a 2-minute explanation for the next session.

**Tool Name:** [e.g., Autopsy]

**Purpose:**  
Briefly describe what the tool does.

**Business Use Case:**  
Explain how it can be used in a business investigation.

**Real-World Example (if available):**  
Summarize a case where this tool was used.
